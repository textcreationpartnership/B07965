            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that defeat of the Archduke <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and his flight into his owne <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thence into <hi>Brisgoia,</hi> to try what forces hee could gather among the <hi>Griſons</hi> and <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> for the reenforcing of his loſt Army: The whole countrey thereabouts, with the Biſhopricke of <hi>Spyres,</hi> was left to the deuotion of the King of <hi>Bohemiah,</hi> now by this victory of <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> made ſole maſter of the field; whereupon the <hi>Manſfeldians</hi> made what rauage they pleaſed in that delicate and moſt fruitfull countrey: And the Count <hi>Van Hannow</hi> of the lower <hi>Alſatia</hi> (neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to <hi>Leopoldus)</hi> taking into his due conſideration, that rule of warre; When two powerfull Princes are either declared or engaged in a warre, it hath beene ſtill obſerued to be a dangerous thing, for any third man to ſtand as a neutrall, who is not able againſt either of them to ſtand of himſelfe: For ſtill the Victor when he hath ouerthrowne the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, falls next vpon the weaker Neuters: So that if the Victor has leiſure afterward to proſecute them,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:184109:6"/> it is as ſafe almoſt, for to haue beene a dependant on the vanquiſhed, as to haue beene onely a looker on: whereas a third man that is of equal power to either of the two <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> ſhall be ſure to be ſolicited by either ſide; Firſt for his aſſiſtance, and if that bee denyed, then ſeeing hee pleaſes not to bee a friend, that he would not aſſiſt the enemy, neither by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring any of his troupes to paſſe through his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, nor that the Campe bee ſupplyed with meat, munition, Armes, &amp;c. from him: And hee may ſtill take his aduantage to chuſe whom to ſide withall; or after the victory he may yet bee welcome to the Victor, or remaine ſtill a Neuter: whereas an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Prince, muſt either come in to the Victor or be ruined, when hee that is too ſtrong for him, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to make neutrality occaſion of a quarrell. This conſideration peraduenture this Count <hi>Van Hannow,</hi> made vſe of, which made him offer his ſeruice to the King: who ſpeedng well, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued both into friendſhip &amp; protection, yet ſo into protection, &amp; vpon ſuch conditions, as free Princes vſe to accept a dependancy vpon a ſtronger party, that is, not to be made a ſubiect, but an Allie and Confederate: Whoſe example hath beene ſuch a leading caſe to others, that a Captaine of much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, good intelligence, and able iudgement in thoſe affaires, who (in his letters from <hi>Manhem May.</hi> 22.) hath related this ſtory, infers thus much thereupon in his very next ſyllables. And I hope (ſaith he) ere long of a greater fortune.</p>
            <p>The 18. of May, they tooke in <hi>Buſweſter,</hi> next to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:184109:6"/> 
               <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> and in it 250 Centeries of Powder, 200 of Match, with ſome Bullets, a murthering peece, and certaine other Ordnance. Thence he went to <hi>Cotton</hi> and tooke that in. <hi>Alſatia</hi> thus left behind without an enemie, and with ſome friends in it, comming neerer home towards the Palatinate; The King &amp; Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> wnet to <hi>Spyers</hi> the chiefe City (and a faire one too) in that Biſhoprike; and beſides that the very chamber of the Empire, where (by this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage it ſeemes) they were as ſafe, as they had been in <hi>Heidlebergh.</hi> For thither came the Marques of <hi>Baden</hi> to them, where vpon a counſell of War it was agreed that their two Armies ſhould thus ſeuerally bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of: That the Marqueſſe <hi>Spiers</hi> being neere his <hi>Baden,</hi> ſhould a while ſtay to ſecure thoſe parts either againſt a revolt, or an enemy that ſhould paſſe through that way, His Leaguer (a ſhort one though it were) he was to make at <hi>Gerſham,</hi> and withall, to block vp <hi>Eddenham,</hi> the only place of the Biſhop of <hi>Spiers</hi> in thoſe parts, which it ſeemes he did in ſome 7. or 8. dayes; for this agreement being made about the 12. the King paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Neckar</hi> with his Army at <hi>Manhem</hi> on the 20. And the Marqueſſe (hauing all ſure at his backe) paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Germerſheim</hi> the 21. to fetch his Army which yet was in his owne Countrey, and about the 23 or 24. was to paſſe to follow the Kings Army into <hi>Derm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt:</hi> (of which wee gaue you an Item in our laſt newes printed the 3. and 5. of <hi>Iune.)</hi> But before we tell you what hath there beene done, will you pleaſe to take ſome of the reaſons of the invaſion of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:184109:7"/> Country abroad before the Palatinate were cleered of enemies at home. Tis iudged, that now this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time of the yeare any Warriour had rather liue vpon his enemies Countrey, then deſtroy his owne; Againe, for that <hi>de Tilly</hi> is not firſt medled withall, may be, for that the <hi>Mansfieldians,</hi> thinke it better to fetch their victuall &amp; proviſion out of this rich and vntouched Countrey, then to lye ſtarving in a Summer Leager, before a full enemie. Againe, the Prince of this <hi>Dermſtadt,</hi> though hee bee of the houſe of the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> who is a <hi>Caluiniſt;</hi> yet is he a Chatholick, and as ſome ſay, a Biſhop too, and hath hitherto furniſhed and befriended the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Palatinate; which they purpoſe by this invaſion, to diſable him from doing hereafter. And there, againe, was the place of meeting appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and the Duke of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> the day prefixed being the 26. of May paſt (after the old ſtile.) The place, vpon the River <hi>Mayne</hi> towards <hi>Franckford,</hi> as we before told you. And indeed this expedition was chiefly intended to open the paſſage for him, and withall to hinder the Baron of <hi>Anhalts</hi> comming to <hi>Dirlandt</hi> in <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and ſo to M. <hi>Tilly:</hi> that ſo by ioyning of 3. faire Armies, the King may bee at once, abſolute Maiſter of the field therabouts, and be able to giue lawes to all <hi>Germanie</hi> if he pleaſe: And the Armies kept together, or divided, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their beſt advantage. But it ſeemes that the Duke hath ſomething diverted his Armes to purſue other deſignes. For about the 10. of May he gaue the overthrow to the Baron of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and ſlew 2000
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184109:7"/> of his men; which battell, (as the advice from <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> written the 19. of May after the old ſtyle, ſayes) was ſtrooke neere <hi>Soltkott</hi> betweene <hi>Gezek</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And next, on the 18. of May he went to <hi>Lisfelt,</hi> where he demanded 150000. dollers of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Abbey; and they offered 80000, but how they ſped, iudge you. And by letters from the <hi>Hage</hi> the 20. <hi>of May,</hi> it appeares he was ſince againe at <hi>Hildeſhem,</hi> which he hath reduced: And the 26. of <hi>May</hi> being appointed for the meeting with the King about <hi>Frankford;</hi> It ſeemes that ſome proiect of his vpon the rich Abbey of <hi>Fulda,</hi> which ſtands at the Citie of <hi>Fuld,</hi> vpon a riuer of that name too; which is in <hi>Heſſen;</hi> about the degrees, 32. 51. This Citie being well watered, is rich in paſture, and in flockes, and eſpecially their commoditie comes in by wooll; which was the reaſon of the planting of a famous Monaſtery there, accounted amongſt the greateſt and richeſt of Germanie; and amongſt them is the Duke; whether to ſing Maſſe or no, I know not. But at this place he was yet about the 28. of <hi>May,</hi> it being ſome ten or twelue German myles from Franckfort the appointed place of meeting. Yet neuertheleſſe the King and Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> (the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden</hi> following within three dayes) went on into <hi>Dermſtadt;</hi> which iourney was rather a progreſſe of pleaſure, (as if the Army had gone on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take the ayre) then a warlike expedition; for as they were not medled withall in their march, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Cordoua,</hi> who (we told you) had ſent all his

And in the Caſtle was the <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> and his ſonne with him ſurprized at vnawares, for he neuer ſo much as ſuſpected an inuaſion; either ſo ſecret was that reſolution of <hi>Spiers</hi> kept, or hee ſo ſecure and negligent. But ſeing his land full of ſoldiers: which once diſcerned not to be his owne, nor his friend <hi>Tillyes,</hi> hee offers an eſcape; vpon which as if hee had confeſt guiltie, and ſomething withall vnder his owne hand being ſhewed againſt him, he was made priſoner, and brought to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> This being done as ſuddenly as hee did that, who wrote <hi>veni, vidi, vici,</hi> that is, in ſome foure dayes; in which time the ſoldiers would want no victuals, there being ſuch ſtore of cattle in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that at the citie of <hi>Franckford,</hi> (as by letters from thence the 26. of <hi>May</hi> appeares) whither theſe boote-halers droue their pillage, a Calfe was ſold for two ſhillings, &amp; a ſheep for one ſhilling En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, &amp; yet they wanted chapmen at that price too; ſo that the ſoldiers are very fluſh: And vpon the 25 of <hi>May</hi> many thouſands of Ricks dollars were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon the water at <hi>Ouenbach,</hi> by 10.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:184109:8"/> and the Papiſts and the Iewes goods with vs in <hi>Franckford,</hi> are like to pay for it. The <hi>Mansfieldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have taken here, the Commiſſioner for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who ſwagger'd it vp &amp; down in his red skarffe, but the red color is now chang'd to Orengetawney, and none of the <hi>Bavarians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi> heere, dare ſhew their heads. Neither hath this onely made an impreſſion of feare amongſt vs, but the Citty and Countrey of <hi>Mentz</hi> have taken the affright alſo.</p>
            <p>And thus, the Country, Citty, Caſtle, and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Dermſtadt</hi> being taken, and all eaſily, and all ſuddenly: The Generall <hi>Mansfield</hi> having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that M. <hi>Tilly</hi> had receiued thoſe ſuccours which he lookt for, being ſome 7000. foot and 800. horſe, from <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and that withall the Baron of <hi>Anhalt</hi> with ſome 5000. more, of the forces of <hi>Cullen,</hi> was come vp to him, whereby his Army was become 24000. ſtrong at the leaſt; and withall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting his purpoſe to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of beſt advantage, to hinder them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Hee therefore through his owne, and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Badens</hi> indiſpoſition of body to fight (having both beene for ſome dayes before, ſicke of the gowt) was not ſo willing now, as he hath beene at other times, to fly on, and hazard a battell; where the two Generalls were ſo much diſabled from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſonall directions: But eſpecially hee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that he had ſomething weakned his Army, by putting in of Garriſons into thoſe Townes which he had lately taken in; And that the enemie was more in the field then hee; And that new commers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:184109:9"/> are ſtill forward to venter and put on at firſt, to get themſelues honour and reputation; and he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peradventure let their bravery and fury ſpend it ſelfe vpon ſome light skirmiſhes with his Reare, which he well knew they would fall vpon; then to force his owne paſſage through the whole and freſh body of their maine Battalion. Therefore there was this courſe agreed vpon; That the Priſes and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, with all the baggage, &amp; luggage of the Army ſhould be ſent home into the Palatinate aforehand, and that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden</hi> ſhould goe before to take the paſſage over the river <hi>Mayne</hi> at <hi>Reusburgh</hi> ſome Dutch mile and a halfe below <hi>Frankford;</hi> But the towne belonging to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Dermſtadt</hi> and hauing correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie with <hi>Tilly,</hi> had aſſurance from him (vpon their ſending to him the newes of <hi>Badens</hi> march thitherward) that hee would withall ſpeed come in to their reſcue, if the towne Garriſon could but make good the place, ſome few houres. So that the towneſmen beeing confident of ſuccours, the Marques perceiuing his paſſage that way ſtopt; and that all the Army could not paſſe the River, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enemie would bee ready to fall vpon thoſe that were paſſing, or not yet paſſed; came off fairely, and Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> who kept the Reare with the greateſt part of the Army, retired in good order and leyſure, as beeing before freed of their Carriages. And yet nevertheleſſe, the Vauntgard of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians</hi> being come up to the reare of the <hi>Mansfieldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> followed them, and skirmiſhed with them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two daies together; In which to confeſſe the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:184109:9"/> truth, and no more but the truth; The Generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending homewards, was vnwilling to turne faces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and to make a ſtand with the whole body of his Army, (ſo at once to receiue the whole ſhocke of the battell vpon him) there were ſome 600. foot, and 60. horſe of ours, cut off; And becauſe I would bee impartiall, I haue heere ſpoken with the moſt, although thoſe that could wiſh them ten times ſo many, will peraduenture at leaſt haue foure times ſo many ſlaine; ſo partiall are many reporters, as ſome haue not let to giue out, that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden</hi> had the defeat of 15000, &amp; the Archduke <hi>Leopol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> they would haue to looſe but 400. But beleeue it, as I heare, ſo I ſpeake nothing vnder the number of common ſouldiers heere ſlaine: And of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, on the Kings ſide, one Colonell <hi>Gulſtein</hi> of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Badens</hi> was kild; a Palſgraue, and a Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> (of the ſame houſe with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Mansfield)</hi> are carried hence priſoners; which two great names, will no doubt make a great noyſe, being ſo nere in title to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> &amp; to the Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> General of the Army. But to enforme theſe men: let them know, that all Princes of the Empire haue this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, that their Paternall titles doe deſcend to all their younger Sonnes; although to keepe vp the houſe, the Lands are onely entaylde to their eldeſt. The reſt, hauing for their portions, either ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Lands, or Summes of Moneyes; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the honour of Governour of ſome Countrey or State in the Country; which makes them ſtill both
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:184109:10"/> to bee employed and accounted of: Or elſe, they muſt make themſelues vp a fortune by the Warres. And thus there are at once diuers Dukes of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> diuers Palſgraues of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and diuers Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Brandenburgh:</hi> the chiefe of which 3. great Families, are diſtinguiſhed from the ſecond houſes, by the addition of <hi>Kurfurſt,</hi> or Elector, put to their ſtiles: And thus is it poſſible (not comparatiuely to inſtance in any) that theſe two priſoners ſhould bee no greater perſonages, then that Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> whom after the defeat of the Archduke <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> Colonell <hi>Overtraut</hi> tooke priſoner at <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> On the Enemies party there were many ſlaine too; and amongſt the reſt, one braue horſe captaine, who being hemd in, did with one Cornet of Horſe, aduenture to charge through a whole Regiment of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Badens</hi> horſe: where being oppreſt with multitude, he was killed, ere he could tell his name; ſome others are heere priſoners with vs too, men of good faſhion, and the beſt forwardnes in the battell: and this skirmiſh continued the 29. and 30. of May. The next day the Enemy proud of it to haue had once the better, came on in the heat of blood, and in a brauado preſented himſelfe in Battalia ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and ſometimes in ſome looſe troopes flying vp and downe before the Trenches of the Kings Reare, who had not yet paſſed the <hi>Neckar</hi> at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem</hi> bridge, but were by the River parted from the reſt of the Campe. And this they did againe the firſt of <hi>Iune;</hi> but by their actions wee know not whether they be friends or enemies, for they haue attempted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:184109:10"/> nothing vpon the kings Folke; who lye ſtill, either to be ready to receiue them if they haue the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to charge, or elſe to waite vpon them whither ſoeuer they ſtirre. And thus haue wee deſcribed enough of the expedition of <hi>Dermſtat,</hi> with the aduentures and skirmiſhes in the returne from thence.</p>
            <p>The two Armies lie now at the gaze one vpon another: which it is expected they will not doe long: For there will be extreme hot ſeruice if either the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> ſhall come vp hither to ioyne with our two Armies; or ſhall reſolue to march vp into <hi>Bauaria:</hi> which it ſeemes the two Princes on the Emperors ſide already ſtand in doubt of: For the Prince Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> muſters his troopes in <hi>Turing;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> makes a Campe at <hi>Dunawert;</hi> which ſtands vpon the <hi>Donaw</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius;</hi> and as <hi>Hondius</hi> Map ſets it, much about the middle of the borders of the vpper Palatinate, <hi>Baua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> So that if he goes on, the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> is likelier to haue neede of his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnder <hi>Mounſieur Tilly,</hi> and to leaue <hi>Don Cordoua</hi> and the Spaniards in the Palatinate, to the mercy of the King of <hi>Bohemiah.</hi> Or if hee comes hither, the King is abſolutely and vncontrouleably, Maſter of the Field. And which of theſe he next does, the next Poſt ſhall bring newes of. In the meane time, he enricheth himſelfe wonderfully. The countrey about <hi>Eichfield</hi> ſo much feares him, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him 100000. Dollers to ſpare it; but hee askes a farre greater ſumme.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:184109:11"/>
            <p> And thus is this ſide of Germany, wholy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled; there being at this time already theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies all at once, and all at this preſent, in the poore Palatinate. Firſt the King himſelfe with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Mansfields</hi> Forces. Then the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden:</hi> both theſe in the field and ioyned: Then the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Vere</hi> in Garriſon of <hi>Hidlebergh, Manhem</hi> and <hi>Franckendall,</hi> and peraduenture by this time the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> alſo come, or a comming, and all on our ſide. On the other ſide; <hi>Don Cordoua</hi> in the Garriſons; and Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> with his ould Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Bauarians,</hi> and new ſupplies out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> &amp; the Biſhop of <hi>Cullens</hi> Generall, the Baron of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halt</hi> ioyned with him. And the other ſide of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in much ſuſpition of the great preparations of <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> ready either to fall vpon <hi>Bohemia, Auſtria, Bauaria,</hi> or ſome other part or Prince of the Empire. So that vnleſſe it will pleaſe God to giue good ſucceſſe to thoſe pious endeauours of our gratious Soueraigne labouring for an vniuerſal Chriſtian peace; we ſhall peraduenture ſhortly ſee, either <hi>Bauaria</hi> or ſome parts of the Empire, as miſerable as the Palatinate is at this day.</p>
            <p>In ſome letters <hi>May</hi> 20. out of the Palatinate, we had an inckling, that <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> was then almoſt in a readineſſe, and altogether in a reſolution to come downe into thoſe parts. And the 22. of <hi>May</hi> were letters written from <hi>Manhem</hi> againe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported what they there heard; that <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> was ſaid to be with a great Army marching towards <hi>Bauaria;</hi> And that the Count <hi>de Tourne</hi> (who is on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:184109:11"/> the King of <hi>Bohemiaes</hi> ſide) beganne to ſtirre on the borders of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and that <hi>Iegerensdorff</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> was as forward as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> hath beene all this while quiet, and now beginnes to buſſle againe; Theſe reaſons haue beene giuen.</p>
            <p>The Turkes expedition into <hi>Poland</hi> fayling of that victory which they bragd of before they won; <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> being not ſupplyed with thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Turkes and Tartars, which were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon drawne out of thoſe parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and the countenance of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> vpon which he ſomething depended, being by his retreat, flight, or ſlaughter of his ſoldiers, leſſe feared in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in the Empire for that time; <hi>Bethlem Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> was willinger to hearken to thoſe conditions of peace propounded vnto him by the Emperor, ſo that all the time of the treaty, while the Articles were conſulted vpon, and afterward till the time of performance was expected, hee was content to lay downe Armes. But conditions being (as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes) not performed on the Emperors part, hee vnwilling that more time ſhould bee gained vpon him, reſolues it ſeemes to fall vpon the Emperor and his friends on that ſide, while moſt of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are embroyled in a tedious warre, on this. But that you may haue ſomething worth your obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may not only ſee the bare euents, but the ſecret counſels alſo, of theſe motions; wee haue here imparted to you a prime peece of intelligence,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:184109:12"/> from a perſon reſident with <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> himſelf, for the ſeruice of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> written to an Engliſh Gentleman, a friend of his, in Germanie, and by that Gentleman himſelfe tranſlated out of the originall Dutch: whereof theſe following are the very ſillables.</p>
            <div type="document">
               <head>Concerning the Agreement betwixt the Emperour and the King of Hungarie, it is paſt on theſe conditions.</head>
               <p>THat the King ſhall deliuer ouer the Crowne to the States of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> which ſhall be kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Trenchſhin,</hi> and the King hath appointed ſix perſons to looke vnto it, three of the States of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> and three of <hi>Hungaria:</hi> and at the Dyet or Land-day, which is to be held at <hi>Edenburk</hi> in <hi>Hungarie</hi> the 1. of May, it ſhall be reſolued how the Crowne ſhall be diſpoſed of.</p>
               <p>2. The Emperour ſhall conſigne vnto the King for his ſecuritie, <hi>Caſſaw,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Gratz, Warrakin,</hi> the Dukedome of <hi>Oplin,</hi> and <hi>Rateboye</hi> in <hi>Silecia;</hi> and to that purpoſe for performance are deputed certaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners by the Emperour: but the States of <hi>Silecia</hi> will by no meanes giue conſent hereunto. The Emperor, they ſay, hath promiſed them to protect and defend them in their priuiledges, and ſo hath no power for to giue away any of their Country, being againſt his owne promiſe.</p>
               <p>3. It is likewiſe agreed that the Emperor ſhall free 14. townes in <hi>Tzips,</hi> which he hath pawned to the King
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:184109:12"/> of <hi>Poland;</hi> but the King of <hi>Poland</hi> will not giue way hereunto.</p>
               <p>4. It is agreed, that the Emperor within one moneth, ſhould ſend to the King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> 4. hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ducats; but the time is already paſt, and no money come.</p>
               <p>5. It is concluded, that the Emperour as long as he liueth ſhall remaine King in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and after his death <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> and yet neuertheleſſe he alſo ſhall haue the name and title of King.</p>
               <p>6. The King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> hath likewiſe reſerued to himſelfe libertie, to acquaint the Great <hi>Turke</hi> with this agreement, betwixt him and the Emperor; and in caſe that he will not conſent thereunto, but ſhall goe about to attempt any matter of hoſtilitie againſt him for it, the Emperor bindeth himſelfe to defend him, and to ſend vnto him at his requiſition, as many forces both of horſe and foot, ordnance, or other munition, as ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for his defence. And the <hi>Turke</hi> is not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this agreement; whereupon he hath ſent to the Emperor a deſignation, That is to ſay, of forty thouſand foote, and fifteene thouſand horſe, 24. great peeces of Ordnance, and fiue hundred Centeries of powder, and ten thouſand great bullets, which he deſireth to haue forthwith for his defence: but how they will be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, let the Emperor take care; ſo that it is impoſsible for the Emp. to hold any one of all theſe Articles: and that the bitterneſſe betwixt him and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> is like to be far greater then euer. Moreouer, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> haue taken an expreſſe reſolution to viſit the Emp. at <hi>Vienna</hi> in Iune next, and for that purpoſe long for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:184109:13"/> nothing more then to ſee the graſſe and Oates on the ground, that I beleeue there will nothing come of this peace or agreement, which I could likewiſe confirme vnto you by other arguments, which I am forbidden to truſt the feather withall, but you ſhall ſhortly receiue aduertiſements more at large by word of mouth.</p>
